# New Mac Setup

A few steps to follow to get a customized Mac experience (just for me).

## First Step

**homebrew** is at the core of the whole setup procedure, in order to install this package manager, go to [Homebrew website](https://brew.sh) and copy the installation script. Or just copy the link down below.

`/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"`

After finishing the installation, don't forget to copy & paste the command lines offered by the script to add brew to PATH.

## Basic tools

One of the most used tools in my use case is a window management software called **Rectangle**, the package can be installed using this command line:

`brew install --cask rectangle`

Also, I use a software called *hazeOver* to dim down the background and non-active windows. I personally purchased it on App Store, but it can also be downloaded using brew:

`brew install --cask hazeover`

_Attention, it is not a free software so if you really like it and want to unlock all functionalities, just purchase it using the way you want._
